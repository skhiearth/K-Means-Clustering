# K-Means-Clustering

Modelling a simple K-Means clustering in Python and R

The dataset is a set of customers of a fictitious shopping center. The mall wants to cluster their customers into different groups and identify most profitable customers. Attributes of the customers are key in determining their groups, and hence a simple K-Means Cluster is modelled.
